## Softwares

[rareGWAMA](/pages/rareGWAMA_page) <br>
*rareGWMA* is a Swiss army knife-like sofeware for imputation based GWAS meta-analysis.
It could perform gene-level tests. The latest implementation is for TESLA (optimal linear combination of association statistics), a novel method for trans-ethnic TWAS (transcriptome-wide association studies).

[simpleMR](https://github.com/funfunchen/simpleMR) <br>
*simpleMR* is a one-stop R package for performing Mendelian randomization using GWAS summary data. It implementes the most popular MR methods on the market, also provides informative diagnostic plots.
